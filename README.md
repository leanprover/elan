# elan: Lean version manager

*elan* is a small tool for managing your installations of the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover.github.io). It places `lean` and `leanpkg` binaries in your `PATH` that automatically select and, if necessary, download the Lean version described in the `lean_version` field of your project's `leanpkg.toml`.
You can also install, select, run, and uninstall Lean versions manually using the commands of the `elan` executable.

```bash
~/my/package $ cat leanpkg.toml | grep lean_version
lean_version = "nightly-2018-04-10"
~/my/package $ leanpkg -v

# Installation

## Manual Installation

**Linux/macOS/Cygwin/MSYS2/git bash/...**: run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
```

**Windows**: run the following commands in a terminal:
```bash
curl -O --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.ps1
powershell -f elan-init.ps1
del elan-init.ps1
```

Alternatively, on **any supported platform**: Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/leanprover/elan/releases/latest) for your platform, unpack it, and run the contained installation program.

The installation will tell you where it will install elan to (`~/.elan` by default), and also ask you about editing your shell config to extend `PATH`. elan can be uninstalled via `elan self uninstall`, which should revert these changes.

## Homebrew

```bash
$ brew install elan
```

## Nix

```bash
$ nix-env -iA nixpkgs.elan
```

# Prerequisites

On some systems, `lean`/`leanpkg` will not work out of the box even if installed through elan:

* You'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/download) to download dependencies through `leanpkg`.
* macOS: Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then run `brew install gmp coreutils`.
  (`gmp` is required by `lean`, `coreutils` is required by `leanpkg`)

# Implementation

*elan* is basically a fork of [rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs). Apart from new features and adaptions to the Lean infrastructure, these are the basic changes to the original code:

* Replaced every mention of `rustup` with `elan`, `cargo` with `leanpkg`, and `rust(c)` with `lean`
* Merged `CARGO_HOME` and `RUSTUP_HOME`
* Removed options to configure host triple

# Build

If you want to build elan from source, you will need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and
Cargo and run the following:

```
cargo build
```

The built binaries will show up in `target/debug` folder.  You can test that it works by running the following:

```
./target/debug/elan --help
```

# Build on Windows

The windows build requires a 64bit developer command prompt and a windows version of `perl.exe` which you can download
from [https://strawberryperl.com/](https://strawberryperl.com/). Make sure this downloaded perl.exe is the first thing
in your PATH so that the build does not try and use `c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\perl.exe`. The git provided version of
perl doesn't work for some reason.

Then you can run `cargo build` as shown above.
